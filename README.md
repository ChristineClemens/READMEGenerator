# Command Line README Generator### Description
This application was designed with the intention of creating a shorthand in which the average user is able to generate a README.md file based upon their own specifications within the command line. In running this application in the command line, users will be prompted to select and define the information that they wish to include. Upon completion, a completed README.md file will be generated using this information. ### Table of Contents
